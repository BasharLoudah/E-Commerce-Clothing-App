E-Commerce Clothing App is a modern mobile application built with Flutter, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for clothing and fashion items. The app features full CRUD functionality for products, category browsing, and a clean, scalable UI inspired by a professional Figma design.

The application empowers both customers and store administrators:

Customers can browse categorized clothing products, view details, and navigate an intuitive shopping experience.

Admin users (store managers) can upload, edit, or delete products directly from the app.
